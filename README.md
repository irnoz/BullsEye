<!-- **Checklists**  -->
Bull's Eye is an application 📱 built to demonstrate use and knowledge of Swift programming language and the following concepts: navigation flow, displaying data lists, and the idea of modeling and persisting your data.

## 💡 About the Project

This project aims to demonstrate the use of Swift and Cocoa. To-do list apps are one of the most popular types of app on the App Store and this is one of them. Bull's Eye uses MVC and Delegate Design Patterns, supports Local Notifications and UserDefaults and for data persistence it encodes and saves elements to the documents folder. The app displays check lists which contain to-do list items, that can be checked if already done.
